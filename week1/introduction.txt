Why are you taking CS 133U?

    Because it meets a requirement for my degree and because I have never
    (successfully) taken a C course before, despite being a developer 
    "for realsies". 

What type of programming experience do you have?

    I currently work as a senior software developer at Capital One.  I've
    got over 15 years' experience as a developer.  

What type of system (Windows, Linux, Apple, etc.) will you use to develop programs?

    More likely than not, some variety of linux, probably Ubuntu inside
    a virtual machine, but some random AWS instance isn't out of the picture if
    I end up travelling a lot this quarter.  (stupid job)

What IDE (DevC++, Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.) will you use to develop programs?

    I use vim with lots of plugins, most notable, neocomplete for token
    completion, neosnippets for putting snippets into neocomplete's UI,
    and ALE, which is an async linter plugin for all sorts of languages.
