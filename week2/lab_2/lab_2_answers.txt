1. Consider the following program: (Page 29, Chapter 2 of King book). Submit i
the answer in this file or a text file with answers along with the questions

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("Parkinson's Law: \nWork expands so as to ");
        printf("fill in the time\n");
        printf("available for its completion. \n");
        getch();
        return 0;
    }

a. Identify the directives and statements in this program. 

	Directives
	----------
	#include <stdio.h>

	Statements
	----------
    printf("Parkinson's Law: \nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill in the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion. \n");
    getch();
    return 0;

b. What output does the program produce?

    Three lines, followed by a newline.  I have surrounded them in quotes ("..") 
    so as to identify trailing whitespace.  

    "Parkinson's Law "
    "Work expands so as to fill in the time"
    "available for its completion. "
